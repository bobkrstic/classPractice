* **Instructions**

    * Your task is to write a function that accepts an array of names and that produces the following kinds of output:

      * For `['Pushkin']`: `Pushkin`.

      * For `['Pushkin', 'Gogol']`: `Pushkin & Gogol`.

      * For `['Pushkin', 'Gogol', 'Zamyatin']`: `Pushkin, Gogol & Zamyatin`.

    * With a partner, write unit tests against this behavior. Once you've described the function sufficiently, kick up a Karma server, and begin implementing the function.

    * Do your tests completely describe the function? Be ready to explain why or why not.
